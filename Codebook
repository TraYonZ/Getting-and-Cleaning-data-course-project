#Description

The code Run_analysis.R do the following steps:

1ยบ) Load the packages and get the data.
2ยบ) We take only the columns with the mean and standard deviation measures. Then we give them the correct names.
3ยบ) Finally, we generate a new dataset with all the average measures for each subject and activity type. The output file is called TidyData.txt.

#Variables

a) x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test contain the data from the downloaded files.
b) train, trainActivities and trainSubjects merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
c) features contains the correct names
d) TidyData.txt contains the relevant averages which will be later stored in a .txt file.
